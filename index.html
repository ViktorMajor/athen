          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Hi! I am Viktor Major, currently a psychology student, but not for long because I have only the state exam left. I really enjoyed my studies but I had some problems with this profession. As you can guess, I am getting my degree in psychology and I am looking for a job as a frontend developer. It sounds strange, but I'll explain. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Psychology is a very important part of my life, not only did I do it at university, but I have applied this knowledge in many jobs as a mentor for disadvantaged gypsy children, a counsellor on the phone with people in crisis or suicidal thoughts. In addition, I had a family which required me to be an active emotional presence at home, so it was quite a stressful situation for me. I started to show signs of burnout. So I started to change course. But only a little. I took a job with a minority rights organization as a program coordinator. And the change opened a door for me.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            I've always had a sense of inadequacy when it comes to the humanities, because I like things that are rational and factual, and let's face it, most of psychology is not like that (there are exceptions, of course). Moving away from psychology, I found a lot of professions based on an exact foundation, and of these, web development is a particular fit for me. There is the possibility to create beautiful things, if I am well positioned I can create socially very useful things and it is based on rational foundations, which was the initial point.
          </p>
          <p>
            So where should i start? It was autumn 2022. I started with a basic course in web development at Codeberry School. By the end, I realized that I was hardworking and smart enough to develop myself in a self-taught way. As much as self-taught can be called developing along the amazing Odin Project and Harvard CS50 curricula. I finished them but continued to develop based on the advice of friends in the industry (Bootstrap, Jest ...)
          </p>
          <p>And now I've come to the point where I'm trying to find a junior job, hence this portfolio.</p>
