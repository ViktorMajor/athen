            My name is Viktor Major, and I am a passionate front-end engineer
            and psychology student based in Pécs, Hungary. I have a strong

        <p>
          I have actively engaged in various personal and academic projects to
          develop my front-end development skills, gaining hands-on experience
          with technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Bootstrap.
          Each day, I am driven to refine my expertise in these areas through
          continuous improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I have completed several online courses and bootcamps,
          which have significantly deepened my knowledge of web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          My professional background in psychology has equipped me with strong
          communication and teamwork skills, which I now leverage in the tech
          industry. As a passionate front-end developer, my focus lies in
          crafting user-centered applications that seamlessly blend
          functionality with visual appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have honed my front-end web development skills through The Odin
          Project and CodeBerry School, where I gained proficiency in React.
          Furthermore, I expanded my programming and algorithmic knowledge by
          completing Harvard's CS50 course.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a technology enthusiast, I remain vigilant for emerging trends in
          front-end development. I have a keen eye for aesthetics and enjoy
          applying innovative solutions to overcome challenges and enhance my
          skillset. My dedication to continuous learning, coupled with an innate
          curiosity, enables me to adapt seamlessly to any cutting-edge,
          tech-driven team. I am eager to contribute meaningfully to exciting
          projects.
